Only two of the passengers on the fluyt survived. A Jew named Solomon Shneur and his daughter Abigail. All other passengers perished, including the rest of their family. Our two Jews reached the island by floating on some wreckage\nSolomon even managed to drag a chest filled with the family gold with them. Very thrifty of him. Another character of our story, Richard Fleetwood, was sailing nearby and heard the sounds of fighting. He arrived too late to catch van Berg, and the 'Mirage' fled. Fleetwood decided to check the island for any survivors\nHe saved Solomon and Abigail from certain death on that desert island. Unfortunately for the old Jew, Solomon does not have a sailor's eye. He mistook Richard's 'Valkerie' for Jacob's 'Mirage' and - terrified the pirate was returning to finish the job - stashed his gold somewhere on the island. As a result, he and his daughter arrived here without a penny, dropped off by Fleetwood at Blanca Lagoon, near Willemstad, their original destination.\nSolomon told me this story. The Dutch Republic supports the free practice of religion. As a part of that policy, the Company supports the Jewish community here. Therefore I made sure they have a roof over their heads, and things to eat and wear. I visited their place a lot. Abigail is a... remarkable young woman.
