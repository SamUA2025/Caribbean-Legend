Though, I admit, this is all Narwhals' and Rivados' fault. When Shark came here with his crew, he wanted to establish a base, but our people and Rivados really disliked the idea. They attacked Shark's brig at night and set it on fire\nThey better didn't! Shark's crew is full of devils, not men, alright. First, they destroyed hostile boats, then landed and started a real slaughter. Narwhals retreated and Rivados ran away as fast as they could. Finally, pirates captured San Augustine where the most of Island's provisions and supplies are held, then they took Tartarus\nShark imprisoned our leader Alan Milrow, who also was my... my close friend, and the Rivados wizard Chimiset. He sent them to rot in Tartarus's cages like beasts. It's easy to swim to Tartarus from here and I managed to visit Alan a few times. There I met Chad Kapper, Shark assigned him as a jailer. I asked Chad to release Alan, promised him money, but he was afraid to confront the admiral\nAnd then Alan was murdered in prison. Chad told me that Shark did this, alright. So I went to Donald, who was elected leader in Alan's place, and demanded to attack the pirates immediately, yet he refused, said that those sea devils are too tough for us. That was when I told him to fuck himself\nMy people were worthless in this matter, so I made a deal with Kapper, the scum wanted to take Shark's place. We had a plan - to lure admiral from his fortress to some shady place and kill him there. We also found a sniper with a good rifle. He could shoot admiral from the Fury's mast\nNow the interesting part is, the day before yesterday I visited Tartarus at night, wanted to say something important to Chad concerning our plan. Swam to the boat and accidentally overheard Chad talking with two Narwhals. Turned out that Shark didn't kill Alan. Chad did. He then secretly spread gossips about admiral's involvement\nHe murdered him because of me. First, he wanted to take me for a plaything in his bed.
