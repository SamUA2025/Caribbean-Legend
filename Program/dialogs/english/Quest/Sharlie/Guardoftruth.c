No doubt that each and every one of them were slaughtered by the martial Itza people who live there\nEventually Inquisitor Vincento had enough of Don Mendosa's fantasies and the pointless death of good soldiers. The inquisitor informed Madrid about the situation. The viceroy forbade Don Mendosa to search for the mythic city and to focus on his duties. That's when Miguel Dichoso showed up\nHe convinced the baron to organize another expedition which surprisingly was a success. They found ruins of an ancient city and a pile of gold encrusted with jewels. But on their return they were attacked by the Mosquito tribe\nAll except Miguel perished, the Indian darts are dipped in some local poison, even a small scratch leads to certain, agonizing death in a few days. Dichoso returned to Providence with what treasure he could carry\nCarajo! The baron was unspeakably happy, he sent urgent letters to Madrid and to Father Vincento in Santiago, no doubt that he wanted to rub his success in the Reverend Father's face.
