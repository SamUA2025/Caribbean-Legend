Of course we could also persuade Marcus to accept the leadership. He is the keeper of the Codex, after all. But I doubt that he would be of any help, he has intentionally limited any contact with Levasseur and Tortuga. A man of principals.\nI have no idea where Steven and his men hide, but his frigate 'Fortune' was seen at Puerto Principe. Perhaps Zachary Marlow, also known as the Black Pastor, can point us to where to look for the Shark. Second, we have to gain the support of the other barons to elect Dodson. And in order to do that, we need to collect their Indian shards - the votes. The new leader must have all five of them. That is what the Code tells us to do in the case that the previous leader has died.\nRidiculous! It is time to change the laws, but only the new leader can do that. We already have my vote. I believe that the Black Pastor doesn't give a damn about whose ass is planted in Sharptown. I hope that Jackman didn't talk to him first. We also have to persuade both Tyrex and Jacques Barbazon, who hate each other. But it is all irrelevant until we find out what has happened with the Shark. Third, one day we will have to kill Jackman and replace him with someone else. He won't negotiate with us.\nToo bad that Hawk is dead! People trusted him and we could use his word. We won't find a better baron for Maroon Town. It is possible that Jackman has something to do with Blaze's murder, so he is also the clue to finding the second part of the map. Jacob trusts no one and most likely keeps the part of the map in his cabin on the 'Centurion'.\nHawks family used to own the frigate, but Jackman claimed it just like Hawk's barony. If we find the second part of the map in Jackman's possession, it would be a great argument for Steven's election. Especially for Marcus Tyrex, the Code keeper, and his over scrupulousness in terms of honor. We will return back to Helen her rights over Isla Tesoro as soon as we acquire both parts of the map.\nWe must be careful though, Jackman won't stay idle and just watch you searching.";
